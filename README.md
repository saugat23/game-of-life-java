# Conway's Game of Life in Java - [Not Completed]

This is a simple console-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Java.

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input. The game is played on a grid of cells, and each cell can be alive or dead based on a set of rules.

## Features

- **Grid Simulation:** The program simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
- **Continuous Animation:** The simulation runs continuously in the console, creating a dynamic and lively visual effect.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/GameOfLifeJava.git
   cd GameOfLifeJava`
   
2. **Compile and Run:**

`javac *.java
java GameOfLife`

3. **Enter Dimensions:**
Follow the prompts to enter the number of rows and columns for the grid.

4. **Enjoy the Simulation:**
Watch the simulation run endlessly with a dynamic display of the evolving grid.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the code to add additional features or modify the simulation parameters. For example, you can experiment with different initial patterns, adjust the speed of the animation, or add a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.

## Dependencies
This project does not have any external dependencies. It utilizes basic Java functionality to create a console-based simulation.
